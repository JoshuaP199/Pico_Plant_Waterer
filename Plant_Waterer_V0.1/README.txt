Pico Plant Waterer first version

Objective for V0.1:
    Create a working project and make sure things don't blow up. :D

Things to work on for next version:
    Clean up wiring 
    Possibly add a display to show information
    Add a solar panel to charge the battery (The server manager is already in use just not hooked up to panel yet)
    If temps get high look into a cooling solution
    Make a better design
